# A Homebrew tap for LAME 3.99.5
Based on the official Homebrew lame formula (3.100)  
[homebrew-core/Formula/lame.rb](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/lame.rb).

<br/>Install lame 3.99.5 from this tap by running:
```bash
brew install shlomiuziel/lame/lame@3.99.5
```

Once lame was built successfully, you can link it as the default lame system-wide command by invoking:

```bash
brew link --force lame@3.99.5
```

#### (This step is required because it's a keg-only formula.)
